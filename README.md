# Work in progress - Automated DCA tool for buying any crypto asset on Kraken

_Please be aware this is work in progress software. Test thoroughly with small amounts of money at first. This software is provided "as is" and comes without warranty. See [LICENSE](LICENSE)._

## This is a fork of Bitcoin DCA tool made by Jorijn
Forked from https://github.com/Jorijn/bitcoin-dca  
I made this fork to support buying any asset which is provided on the Kraken exchange.

## Requirements
* You need to have an account on a supported exchange;
* You need to have Docker installed: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/;
* You need to have an API key. It needs **read**, **trade** and **withdraw** permission.

## Supported assets for withdrawing

|Bitcoin|BTC or XBT|
|Ethereum|ETH|
|Cardano|ADA|

Feel free to submit a request for other assets by adding a feature request issue: https://github.com/Sebastix/crypto-dca/issues/new/choose

## About this software
The DCA tool is built with flexibility in mind, allowing you to specify your own schedule of buying and withdrawing. A few examples that are possible:

* Buy each week, never withdraw.
* Buy monthly and withdraw at the same time to reduce exchange risk.
* Buy each week but withdraw only at the end of the month to save on withdrawal fees.

## How to use this tool
Please read the documentation from Bitcoin-DCA: [https://bitcoin-dca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://bitcoin-dca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for all details you need to get started with this software.
In this fork, the commands you use for buying and withdrawing are slightly different.

Test if the application is working:
`docker run --rm -it --env-file=/home/bob/crypto-dca/.env ghcr.io/sebastix/crypto-dca:latest balance`
If everything is working, you will see the balance of your exchange account.

Buy an asset (buy for 100 euro of asset X):   
`docker run --rm -it --env-file=/home/bob/crypto-dca/.env ghcr.io/sebastix/crypto-dca:latest buy 100 <asset>`

Withdraw all your chosen assets from your account to your wallet address:  
`docker run --rm -it --env-file=/home/bob/crypto-dca/.env ghcr.io/sebastix/crypto-dca:latest withdraw <asset> --all`
